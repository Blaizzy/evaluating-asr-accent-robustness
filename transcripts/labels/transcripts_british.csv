PUT THE CHART ON THE MANTEL AND TACK IT DOWN
THE NIGHT SHIFT MEN RATE EXTRA PAY
THE RED PAPER BRIGHTENED THE DIM STAGE
SEE THE PLAYER SCOOT TO THIRD BASE
SLIDE THE BILL BETWEEN THE TWO LEAVES
MANY HANDS HELP GET THE JOB DONE
WE DON'T LIKE TO ADMIT OUR SMALL FAULTS
NO DOUBT ABOUT THE WAY THE WIND BLOWS
DIG DEEP IN THE EARTH FOR PIRATE'S GOLD
THE STEADY DRIP IS WORSE THAN A DRENCHING RAIN
A FLAT PACK TAKES LESS LUGGAGE SPACE
GREEN ICE FROSTED THE PUNCH BOWL
A STUFF CHAIR SLIPPED FROM THE MOVING VAN
THE STITCH WILL SERVE BUT NEEDS TO BE SHORTENED
A THIN BOOK FITS IN THE SIDE POCKET
THE GLOSS ON TOP MADE IT UNFIT TO READ
THE HAIL PATTERED ON THE BURNT BROWN GRASS
SEVEN SEALS WERE STAMPED ON GREAT SHEETS
OUR TROOPS ARE SET TO STRIKE HEAVY BLOWS
THE STORE WAS JAMMED BEFORE THE SALE COULD START
IT WAS A BAD ERROR ON THE PART OF THE NEW JUDGE
ONE STEP MORE IN THE BOARD WILL COLLAPSE
TAKE THE MATCH AND STRIKE IT AGAINST YOUR SHOE
THE POT BOILED BUT THE CONTENTS FAILED TO JELL
THE BABY PUTS HIS RIGHT FOOT IN HIS MOUTH
THE BOMBS LEFT MOST OF THE TOWN IN RUINS
STOP AND STARE AT THE HARD WORKING MAN
THE STREETS ARE NARROW AND FULL OF SHARP TURNS
THE PUP JERKED THE LEASH AS HE SAW A FELINE SHAPE
OPEN YOUR BOOK TO THE FIRST PAGE
FISH EVADE THE NET AND SWIM OFF
DIP THE PAIL ONCE AND LET IT SETTLE
WILL YOU PLEASE ANSWER THAT PHONE
THE BIG RED APPLE FELL TO THE GROUND
THE CURTAIN ROSE AND THE SHOW WAS ON
THE YOUNG PRINCE BECAME HEIR TO THE THRONE
HE SENT THE BOY ON A SHORT ERRAND
LEAVE NOW AND YOU WILL ARRIVE ON TIME
THE CORNER STORE WAS ROBBED LAST NIGHT
A GOLD RING WILL PLEASE MOST ANY GIRL
THE LONG JOURNEY HOME TOOK A YEAR
SHE SAW A CAT IN THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE
A PINK SHELL WAS FOUND ON THE SANDY BEACH
SMALL CHILDREN CAME TO SEE HIM
THE GRASS AND BUSHES WERE WET WITH DEW
THE BLIND MAN COUNTED HIS OLD COINS
A SEVERE STORM TORED DOWN THE BARN
SHE CALLED HIS NAME MANY TIMES
WHEN YOU HEAR THE BELL COME QUICKLY
