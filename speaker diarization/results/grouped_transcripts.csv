SPEAKER_00,0.0,59.8," Here's my problem.  My brain is melting right now because I have to juggle  100 apps just to communicate with eight people.  When I was in college, there were three ways  to get a hold of me.  Call me if you're confident.  Text me if you're shy.  Email me if you're smart.  Now, it's 100 apps.  I message friends, Android, annoying friends,  Signal, pretentious college friends, WhatsApp,  annoying family members, Instagram DMs,  corny randos, Twitter DMs, angry political randos,  E-Vite, psychos, paperless posts, liberal psychos.  That's just messaging, Marques.  Yeah, so you do have the option to not try  any of the things you don't want.  Until I go to a restaurant, you go,  hey, can I get a menu?  Yeah.  And they go, oh, yeah, just scan the QR code.  And I go, no, no, no, I went to this restaurant  to avoid being on my phone, and then they're like,  oh, you have to also pay through your phone.  In order to do that, you have to create  a username and password.  Oh, okay, so you see what I'm saying?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just made this, I'll have the tuna melt,  six steps harder."
